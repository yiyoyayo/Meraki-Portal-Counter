# Meraki-Portal-Counter

This is a software project designed for a retail customer using Meraki. Project is designed to showcase Meraki API capabilities and is based on assumptions. Please refer to detailed "User Guide.pdf" documentation provided in this repo.


## Use Case Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a solution for the retailer so they can get people traffic information easily. By using the analytical results, retailers have insights of the market trends and customer interests, which contribute in a targeted marketing campaign and successful business strategy.

This project is not a fully working solution. This is more of a proof of concept to illustrates the capabilities of Meraki products and how they help achieve desired outcome of the case study.
This project uses the following:
* Meraki cameras to detect and count people entering and leaving the store
* Meraki access points to detect and count devices in the store
* Meraki Captive Portal to capture the customersâ€™ information, and redirect them to products of interest.
* Kibana to visualize the customer traffic and device information.
* Backend code written in python.

## Software dependencies
* Python 3
* Elasticsearch
* Kibana
* ngrok
* Meraki AP and Meraki Camera

## Installation

* You would need to install all software dependencies listed above
* Setup ngrok
  * [Install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
  * Replace ```$HOME/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml``` with *ngrok.yml* file from this repo.
  * This will allow you to automatically run 4 tunnels you need for the main applications.
  * Note, you will need to register for ngrok if you want to run multiple tunnels. Don't worry, it's free.
  * You should get one ngrok URL for every python script based on the port that script uses. More on this in Description section.
* Install Elasticsearch
  * [On MAC and Linux](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/targz.html)
  * [On Windows](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-windows.html)
* Install Kibana
  * [On Mac and Linux](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/targz.html)
  * [On Windows](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/windows.html)
* [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * 3.x is required
* Install python dependencies
  * Open terminal in root directory of this folder and run following commands.
  * Ensuring you have *requirements.txt* file, run : ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
* Once you have your ngrok URLs you would need to add these to Meraki Dashboard. __For these remaining steps, I would recommend you look at "User Guide.pdf" documentation provided in this repo. It is more comperhensive walkthough with nice pictures__
* You need to get Meraki camera API key and Camera serial number and change the following values in *config.py* file:
  * MERAKI_API_KEY
  * CAMERA_SERIAL
* You need to do similar for location scanning part, for which you need to obtain API Key and "secret" phrase, and update the following values in *config.py* file:
  * VALIDATOR
  * SECRET


## Configuration

Please refer to detailed "User Guide.pdf" documentation provided in this repo.

## Usage

Please refer to detailed "User Guide.pdf" documentation provided in this repo.

## How to test the software

### Start ngrok tunnel
Assuming you have copied *ngrok.yml* in previously mentioned directory, you can just run:
  ```
  ngrok start -all 
  ```
If you have not, or you wish to test each script separetrly you can run single ngrok tunnel:
  ```
  ngrok http <port_number>
  ```
For example, to run tunnel for elasticsearch only, you would do:
  ```
  ngrok http 9200
  ```
Assuming you have not changed default port elastic is running on (i.e. 9200).

#### Why do we need ngrok?

* Elasticsearch, Kibana, *meraki_captive_portal.py* and *location_scanning_v2.py* run as servers. 
* Both meraki_captive_portal.py and location_scanning_v2.py need ngrok tunnel because we need to provide this URL to Meraki Camera and AP.
* Elasticsearch and Kibana can be run locally.
* In fact all these servers are running locally (i.e. localhost). What ngrok does, it provides public URL (i.e. domain) that points to your localhost:<port>, that Meraki Dashboard can access. 
* By default (and you will see this when you look at the code) these are default localhost ports these applications are using:
  * meraki_captive_portal   : __5004__
  * location_scanning_v2.py : __5000__
  * Elasticsearch           : __9200__
  * Kibana                  : __5601__
  
  * NOTE: All python scripts use ngrok URL when writing data to Elasticsearch. This is placed under variable named __ES_HOST_URL__ in *__config.py__* file, so if you re-run ngrok you would need to change URL or change it to localhost:9200 (if you do not change elastic default port of course).
  * Oh yea, since we are using free version of ngrok, everytime you re-run it, it will give you a different URL, so you need to update Meraki Dashboard and *__config.py__* file.

### Initiate Elasticsearch and Kibana

* In Termial, navigate to where you extrcted elasticsearch then type:
```
./bin/elasticsearch
```
* If you want to test it manually, wait for a minute or so, then in your browser go to __localhost:9200__ or __respective ngrok URL__ to see if elastic is up and running. You should get json object displayed. Otherwise if you run your python scripts it will tell you if there is an issue with elastic.

* In a separate terminal, navigate where you extracted kibana then type:
```
./bin/kibana
```
* To test and access your data, in your browser go to __localhost:5601__ or __respective ngrok URL__. Kibana UI should pop up. On how to use Kibana interface refer to our "User Guide.pdf" document included in this repo.

* __NOTE__: If you are running this code for the very first time, once you have elastic up and running, run the following python script:
```
pyhton3 elastic_onetime.py
```
  * You only need to run this once (i.e. when you are setting up elasticsearch for the first time). __This scrip will create all relevant indecies for elasticsearch where you can store your data.__
  
* The following is the mapping of which script uses which elasticsearch index:

Python Script | Elasticsearch Index
------------- | -------------------
camera_count_v2.py | __camera_count__
location_scanning_v2.py | __scanning_count__
meraki_captive_portal.py | __splash_count__

### Run Python Scripts
There are 3 main functions: camera_count_v2, location_scanning_v2.py and meraki_captive_portal.py.
Run each one in a separate terminal.
  ```
  python3 camera_count_v2.py
  ```
  ```
  python3 location_scanning_v2.py
  ```
  ```
  python3 meraki_captive_portal.py
  ```
  # Testing
  * You should be all up and running now.
  * You can test by using camera and AP (i.e. walk into the frame or camera, and/or connect to wifi)
  * Then you can go to ngrok URL that is pointing to Kibana (i.e. localhost:5601) and you will see all of the collected data.
  * Refer to "User Guide.pdf" documentation provided in this repo for more information on how to use Kibana to display your information. Alternatively, you can see demo video.

### Authors Note
* We did not really had much time to create unit test (sorry...) but you can kinda test some scripts without needing Meraki AP.
* Most scripts are dependent on Meraki AP and Camera in order to test their functionality.
* You can test elasticsearch without requirement for any ngrok. Simply run it locally and change ES_HOST_URL to localhost:9200. Similarly you can do this for Kibana too.
* You can test splash page without need for Meraki hardware.
  * Run ``` python3 meraki_captive_portal.py``` and ```ngrok htto 5004``` (ngtok is optional here)
  * Then copy the following string:
  > <your_server>/click?base_url = "base_grant_url=https%3A%2F%2Fn143.network-auth.com%2Fsplash%2Fgrant&user_continue_url=http%3A%2F%2Fmeraki.com%2F&node_id=1301936&node_mac=00:18:0a:13:dd:b0&gateway_id=1301936&client_ip=10.162.50.40&client_mac=44:55:66:77:88:BB
  * Where <your_server> is either localhost:9200 or ngrok URL.
  * You should then be greeted by splash page where you can follow through.
  * Once you submit your response, you will be redirected based on the interests you selected.
  * Either in your terminal or in Kibana (if you are running elastic) you will be able to see information captured from the captive portal.
  
## Known issues
* In the scenario where 1 person has multiple devices, the current version will count it as multiple clients
* The current version cannot solve the random MAC address issue - device will be counted as different device if their MAC address changed

## Getting help
